# COVID-19 Radiography Analysis ðŸ©»ðŸ“Š

This project demonstrates end-to-end data analysis and predictive modeling using radiographic image data to classify COVID-19 and other lung conditions. The goal was to explore machine learning approaches to medical imaging problems using structured metadata and visual patterns in chest X-rays.

## Project Overview
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a radiography dataset with labeled X-ray images.
- Preprocessed image metadata and engineered relevant features for modeling.
- Evaluated multiple classification models to identify the most effective algorithm.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters and measured model performance using accuracy, precision, and recall.
- Created visualizations and confusion matrices to assess model strengths and weaknesses.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `numpy`
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

> Random Forest outperformed other models with the best classification metrics.

## Key Skills Demonstrated
- Data preprocessing and wrangling
- Supervised machine learning (classification)
- Model evaluation and selection
- Data visualization and reporting
- Domain understanding of biomedical datasets
