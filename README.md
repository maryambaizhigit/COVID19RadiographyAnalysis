# 🩻 COVID-19 Radiography Analysis with Machine Learning and SAM-2

This project demonstrates an end-to-end analysis pipeline using radiographic image data to classify COVID-19 and other lung conditions. The goal was to apply both traditional machine learning models and modern deep learning-based segmentation techniques to explore insights in chest X-rays.

In addition to classification tasks, I also implemented **SAM-2 (Segment Anything Model)** to highlight regions of interest within X-ray images—bridging structured metadata analysis with pixel-level segmentation.

## 🔍 Project Overview
- Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on labeled chest X-ray datasets.
- Cleaned and preprocessed metadata, engineered features for structured modeling.
- Applied and evaluated multiple classification algorithms for disease prediction.
- Used SAM-2 to perform semantic segmentation on chest X-rays.
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters and compared model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and visualizations.
